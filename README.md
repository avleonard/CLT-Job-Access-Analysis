# Minding the Gap: CLT Transit & Job Access

## Description

From the final Data Science Studio of my undergrad, this project analyzes how many jobs are within a ½-mile walkshed of Charlotte’s fixed-guideway transit (LYNX) and where the largest access gaps exist. Using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and job distribution data, we measure jobs inside and outside the walkshed, compare patterns by job type, and overlay equity indicators such as income and transit dependence.

By providing map-driven evidence for prioritization corridors and last-mile improvements, the project aims to inform planning decisions for greater equity and opportunity across Charlotte’s transit network.
